        <h2>What Is “Ink Therapy” (If You Care)?</h2>
        <p>
            Look, some people call it <strong>ink therapy</strong> — the idea that getting tattooed helps you
            deal with emotional crap. Trauma, grief, identity, whatever. For most of us, it’s not that deep.
            It just feels right.

        <h2>Fun Facts (So You Can Sound Smart While Getting Inked):</h2>
        <ul style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
            <li>Ötzi the Iceman had tattoos 5,300 years ago. You’re just following tradition.</li>
            <li>Ink sits in the dermis layer of your skin — that’s why it lasts. Science.</li>
            <li>Tattoos can release endorphins. It’s literally a controlled pain high.</li>
            <li>Some people walk out of the shop feeling lighter. Mentally, not just in the wallet.</li>
            <li>If anyone asks “why?” — just stare blankly and say “Because I f***ing wanted to.”</li>
        </ul>
